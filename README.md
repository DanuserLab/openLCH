# Live Cell Histology - 

(image from publications )
abstract =  we demonstrate that the latent features extracted from label-free live cell images by an adversarial auto-encoding deep convolutional neural network capture subtle details of cell appearance that allow classification of melanoma cell states, including the metastatic efficiency of seven patient-derived xenograft models that reflect clinical outcome. Although trained exclusively on patient-derived xenograft models, the same classifier also predicted the metastatic efficiency of immortalized melanoma cell lines suggesting that the latent features capture properties that are specifically associated with the metastatic potential of a melanoma cell regardless of its origin. We used the autoencoder to generate {\textquotedblleft}in-silico{\textquotedblright} cell images that amplified the cellular features driving the classifier of metastatic efficiency. These images unveiled pseudopodial extensions and increased light scattering as functional hallmarks of metastatic cells. .}
